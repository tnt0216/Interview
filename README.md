Technical Interview Repo
=======================

Welcome! I have created this repo specifically for interviews. I have included code from my master's research that utilized ML techniques and code from the team Lockheed Martin-sponsored project that focused on astrodynamic calculations for a satellite constellation. 

My master's research project was conducted between July 2023 and Decemeber 2024
I worked on the Lockheed-sponsored project between December 2022 and May 2023
