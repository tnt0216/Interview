Technical Interview Repo
=======================

Welcome! I have created this repo specifically for interviews. I have included code from my master's research that utilized ML techniques to assess the rheological/tensile similarity of fluorinated thermoplastics and code from the team Lockheed Martin-sponsored project that focused on astrodynamic calculations for a satellite constellation. 


*Project Timelines*

- Master Research: July 2023 - December 2024

- Lockheed-sponsored: December 2022 - May 2023

**No proprietary data is included in this repo.**
